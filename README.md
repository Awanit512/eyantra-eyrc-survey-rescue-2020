Survey &amp; Rescue (SR) In eYRC 2019-20 we explore an abstracted version of this disaster scenario, using a micro-quadcopter which operates autonomously to perform search and rescue operations. In the process we learnt concepts in control systems(PID), image processing and algorithm development . The competition tasks were splitted into a series of mini - Tasks which helps accomplish the above goal(survey and rescue ) of solving the problem using an autonomous quadcopter.
